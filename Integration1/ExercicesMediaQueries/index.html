                    <p>The series takes place over 360 years in the future, with most episodes set in the year 2384, in a futuristic metropolis known as Bay City.
                        In the future, a person's memories and consciousness can be decanted in a disk-shaped device called a cortical stack, which is implanted in the vertebrae at the back of the neck.
                        These storage devices are of alien design and have been reverse engineered and mass produced.
                        Physical human or synthetic bodies are called "sleeves" and stacks can be transferred to new bodies after death, but a person can still be killed if their stack is destroyed.
                        While this theoretically means anyone can live forever, only the wealthiest, known as "Meths" in reference to Methuselah, have the means to do so through clones and remote storage of their consciousness in satellites.</p>

            <p>More than 300 years in the future, society has been transformed by new technology, leading to human bodies being interchangeable and death no longer being permanent.
                Takeshi Kovacs is the only surviving soldier of a group of elite interstellar warriors who were defeated in an uprising against the new world order.
                His mind was imprisoned for centuries until impossibly wealthy businessman Laurens Bancroft offers him the chance to live again.
                Kovacs will have to do something for Bancroft, though, if he wants to be resurrected. Bancroft's request of Kovacs is to solve a murder -- Bancroft's.

            <p class="text-white">The Raven Hotel is run by Poe, an Artificial Intelligence, for more than fifty years.
                Takeshi Kovacs checks into the hotel after being resleeved, and is Poe's first guest for nearly fifty years.
                <br><br>Poe advertises the Raven as "Bay City's most macabre lodging establishment."
                The Raven is fully licensed to protect guests, and includes two hidden rotary machine guns in the lobby.
                <br><br>It is an old fashioned AI run hotel. These hotels were hard wired to WANT customers, therefore they present what some might call "stalker-like" behaviour.
                During the period that Takeshi is on ice, exact date isn't specified, there was a corporate war. <br><br>During this time these hotels were fitted with military grade weaponry to protect their guests. Following the end of said war the hotels weren't decomissioned.
                <br><br>Now going back to why people don't stay in these hotels very often. Imagine a psycho-stalker ex with military grade weaponry and you might come to the conclusion you want to stay away from that place.</p>
